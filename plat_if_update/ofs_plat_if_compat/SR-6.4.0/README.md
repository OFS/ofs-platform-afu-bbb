Updates for the SR-6.4.0 release given an untarred copy of
BBS_6.4.0/skxp_mcp_640_gbs_dev_pkg_ww38.tar.gz.

The transformed build environment is compatible only with OPAE, since the platform interface
manager is integrated into the OPAE SDK. The blue/green boundary remains unchanged and builds
are compatible with the standard SR-6.4.0 FIU.

HSSI has not been tested.
