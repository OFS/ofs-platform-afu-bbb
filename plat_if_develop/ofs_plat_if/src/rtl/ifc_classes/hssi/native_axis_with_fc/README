This is the HSSI interface used in OFS releases on Agilex. A vector of HSSI channels
holds RX and TX AXI-S data interfaces. In addition to the data streams, each channel
has a flow control interface on which pause requests are passed.

Within a single channel, the RX, TX and pause interfaces share a clock. The clock
is not guaranteed to be common across channels.

The PIM provides only an AXI-S data option. Avalon is no longer an option directly
from the PIM.
