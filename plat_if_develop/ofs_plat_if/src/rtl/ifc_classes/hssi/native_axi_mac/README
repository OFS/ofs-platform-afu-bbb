This HSSI interface was used only by the early access OFS release on the d5005
board. A vector of HSSI channels holds RX and TX AXI-S data interfaces. In addition
to the data streams, each channel has a pair of sideband channels on which pause
requests are passed.

All channels are assumed to share a common clock.

The EA FIM provided methods for mapping from the AXI-S data streams to an Avalon
interfaces. The PIM makes both AXI-S and Avalon available.
