Bandwidth/latency tests. To run, compile an instance of the host_chan_params hardware.
The AXI-MM default test is a good choice (../../hw/rtl/test_axi0_default.txt).

Run:
  ../host_chan_params --lat | tee <data file>

  plot_perf.sh <data file> <output pdf> "Description"

"Description" is the prefix on graph pages in the generated PDF. Use something like
"D5005 OFS AXI-MM".

The graphs show bandwidth (left Y axis) and latency (right Y axis) as a function
of offered load (X axis). Offered load is the maximum number of outstanding lines
allowed to be in flight at the same time. An offered load of 1 emits a single request
and waits for the response before emitting another. At some point, the offered load
exceeds the bandwidth of the bus. At that point, bandwidth no longer increases but
latency spikes because requests back up in the request pipeline. Once the request
pipeline fills, latency stops increasing because the AFU can no longer inject new
requests.

The data files hold more than is plotted. For example, a FIM-only average latency
is calculated. This separates the latency through the PIM and the FIM.
